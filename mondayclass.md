#The Project

-  Don't need to deliver a working final product.  Maybe just a prototype or design.



#Prototyping  (just read the slide)

-  Reduces risk 

-  Discussion of iPhone prototype

-  Storyboards:  Don't be afraid to draw on paper

-  Want to give the customer an idea of what the design process is  

-  Just because a prototype does something doesn't mean a full product will do it

#What is missing from a software prototype

-  code

-  exception handling

-  Don't need to handle every scenario in a prototype

-  no need to do documentation

#Who builds, sees, and uses the prototype

-  prototyping helps with testing

-  Don't put stuff in your prototype you can't test

#Risks of prototyping

-  time: could be using the time to do actual development


#What is Design?

#Design Space

-  you have to know what the framework is.  Set your boundaries.  Know what you're building.

#An Aside

-  Divide and Conquer.  But don't forget about the connectivity between the pieces.

#What is a bug?

-  RTFM

-  Not everything is a bug.  Sometimes it's a feature.  Maybe you disagree.

-  Sometimes people put bugs in intentionally so they can have job security.  This is not ethical.

#After We Ship

-  Example of MALOC bug in early versions of Firefox.

-  Java releases memory for you.   But C++ and C does not.  Beware.

#A Series of Amusing Cartoons

#Prioritize Bugs

-  Whenever you hear someone say the problem was an "ID ten T" problem, they mean "IDIOT" (ID10T)

-  Know what bugs you can ship with
